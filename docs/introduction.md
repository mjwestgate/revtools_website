## What is evidence synthesis?
Evidence synthesis is the process of searching, collating and interpreting scientific information. Of course, this definition covers a whole range of possible  activities, from simple literature searches on a single topic or question, right through to a full systematic review or meta-analysis. Whatever their goal, however, many researchers are finding it increasingly difficult to keep track of the amount of literature that they must read to gain an overview of a given research field. This is where revtools can help.

In practical terms, revtools provides some simple functions for importing and managing 'bibliographic' data; i.e. lists of books or articles, when they were published, and who they were authored and published by. Rather than just import these data, however, revtools also includes a number of user interfaces (built with Shiny) to help you interactively sort and categorize that content. These functions support a range of tasks from manually sorting article titles or abstracts, right through to automated cluster identification using topic models. By default, each interface hides identifying information of each article, meaning that revtools is consistent with the screening guidelines for systematic reviews given by <a href="https://www.cochrane.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cochrane</a>, the <a href="https://campbellcollaboration.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Campbell Collaboration</a>, or the <a href="http://www.environmentalevidence.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collaboration for Environmental Evidence</a>.

This site gives you some basic information on how to import, de-duplicate, and screen articles using revtools.
