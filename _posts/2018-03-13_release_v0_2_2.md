title: revtools version 0.2.2 released
---
The new version of <code>revtools</code> is up on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=revtools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRAN</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mjwestgate/revtools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> now. Updates in this version are as follows:
<ul>
	<li><code>revtools</code> now uses <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modal-dialogs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modals</a> to show when new topic models are being calculated, or when results are saved. This is a marked improvement that lets the user know when the GUI is temporarily inoperative.</li>
	<li>Cleaner import of .ris files.</li>
	<li>New argument <code>remove_words</code> allows the user to exclude specific words from the topic model when calling <code>start_review_window</code>. The default is to use <code>tm::stopwords</code> (this was true in v. 0.2.1 as well), so there is no need to add basic stop words each time.</li>
	<li>Bug fix: Interactively excluding words in <code>start_review_window</code> then running a topic model used to cause mismatches between hover and selected text - this has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
One issue with v0.2.2 is that revtools no longer installs the <code>SnowballC</code> package by default, so if you don't have it installed already, you'll now be prompted to install it whenever you run either of the functions <code>make_DTM</code> or <code>start_review_window</code>.
